Why do I have to suffer the wrath of not having a router?


kiki [16:44] 
C’est la vie


codingquark [16:52] 
I was shown the dreams 
Of industrial switches 
I am given things 
Of industrial pains

kiki [16:52] 
you will appreciate the past! pain is all about learning!


codingquark [16:55] 
The wrenching heart 
The befalling pain 

You take consolation 
In learning 
In memories 
In coming through 

Heart is a Desert of Thorns 
And the Thorns do not console.


kiki [16:57] 
Be it a thorn or an axe 
The heart is like a tree 
The axe forgets 
But the tree remembers 
The scars and the times


codingquark [16:58] 
The visions of a switch sending packets 
The visions of blinking lights 
The visions of streams of data 

Oh how I had wished to bathe in the signals of wireless fidelity

kiki [17:02] 
Wishing for wireless fidelity and lightning speeds, 
you forgot the paths taken to reach here; 
you forgot the roots. 
Paths filled with the shrills and cries of modems. 


codingquark [17:11] 
It takes a beast to enable communications! 
The green fiery eyes of the beast must be kept blinking 
The true eye must be kept from becoming red 

Many horns of the beast are the key to long range 
Many cores of the beast’s brain are the key to support many users 
The beast must be kept calm and cool, venting heatThe beast has a mood 

When in a bad mood, it disrupts all moods 
And the world goes silent. (edited)
